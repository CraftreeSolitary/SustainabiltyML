# Multi-Class Animal Classification using Custom Convolutional Neural Networks
This project explores the development of a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classifying images of various animals. 

### Contents
1. Prepare a dataset: Organize a dataset of animal images for one-vs-rest, binary, and five-class classification tasks.
2. Develop a custom CNN model: Design and implement a CNN architecture from scratch, without relying on pre-existing architectures like ResNet or DenseNet.
3. Train and evaluate the model: Train the model on the prepared datasets using 3-fold cross-validation to assess its performance.
4. Analyze and visualize features: Generate and analyze the output of convolutional layers to understand the features automatically learned by the model during training.
5. Evaluate performance: Utilize classification matrices to visualize the model's performance in each classification scenario.
